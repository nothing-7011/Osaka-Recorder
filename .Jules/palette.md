## 2024-05-30 - [Haptic Feedback for Primary Actions]
**Learning:** Users who perform primary actions (like "Record" or "Shutter") often do so without looking directly at the UI or while under time pressure. Visual feedback alone can be missed.
**Action:** Add `haptic.performHapticFeedback(HapticFeedbackType.LongPress)` (or `Medium`) to the `onClick` handler of the screen's primary action button to provide immediate physical confirmation of the state change.
