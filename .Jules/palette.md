## 2024-05-22 - [Empty States Matter]
**Learning:** Users react positively to empty states that guide them rather than just informing them of emptiness. A centered icon and clear instruction is better than a list item saying "No items".
**Action:** When creating list views, always design a dedicated full-screen empty state with an icon and call to action/explanation, separate from the list container.
