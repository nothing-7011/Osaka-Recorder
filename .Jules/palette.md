## 2024-05-23 - Empty States as Guidance
**Learning:** Users often encounter empty states (like an empty history list) when they first launch an app. A blank screen or a plain text "No items" feels like an error or a dead end. Providing a visual cue (icon) and a helpful prompt (what to do next) transforms this dead end into an onboarding opportunity.
**Action:** Always verify "zero data" states for lists and grids. Implement a reusable "Empty State" component that accepts an icon, title, and optional call-to-action or description.
